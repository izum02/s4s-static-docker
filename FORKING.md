This file contains instructions on what you should do upon forking PenguinMod.

You don't HAVE to follow this document but it'll prevent a lot of confusion for your users and likely prevent your mod from being blacklisted from our internal servers.

# Branding changes
Update any labels or text that says "PenguinMod" and put your mod's name.
You shouldn't do this for IDs or anything like that.

You should also update your credits & privacy policy pages. Some contributors may not be ok with being listed as working on your mod directly.

Update any links to our github to yours so people can find the source code. Also make sure to update links that you have your own version of like feedback, docs, or packager.

### The "don't do that" section
Don't remove any credit to Scratch, TurboWarp, or PenguinMod. That's just not cool.  
Imagine if someone just forked your copy and pretended they made it all themselves.

Don't change the license or visibility of your repositories if you don't know or understand what you are doing.

# Server changes
Unless you plan on keeping your mod 100% compatible with PenguinMod, please remove the Upload button and any project sharing features.

Our APIs are only built for PenguinMod and therefore will likely end up breaking in your mod at some point or another.

We also do not allow projects that only work outside of PenguinMod so if we end up having a lot of broken uploads from your site, then we'll have to block your site from being able to use the project API.
